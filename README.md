# Media Tracker - Efficient Media File Management for Android

Media Tracker is an Android application designed to help users manage and track media files effectively. Whether you're organizing your music collection, managing videos, or sorting through photos, Media Tracker simplifies the process by allowing you to monitor changes in specified directories and automatically copy files to designated locations.

Features:

File Monitoring: Media Tracker continuously observes specified directories for file modifications, such as creations, modifications, deletions, or moves.
Automatic File Copying: Upon detecting changes, Media Tracker automatically copies the files to user-defined destination folders.
User-Friendly Interface: The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for selecting source and destination directories, making it easy to configure and use.
Background Service: Media Tracker operates as a background service, ensuring seamless file management without interrupting your other tasks.
Permission Management: The app assists users in handling necessary permissions, such as storage and boot permissions, to ensure smooth functionality.

You can also use Media Tracker as a WhatsApp media spy app. When people share media files through WhatsApp, these images are saved in local storage. Using Media Tracker, users can copy those media files to another directory. For example, if your girlfriend shared media files with you and then deleted them, installing Media Tracker on her device would save those files in another destination folder. Later, you can check those media files.

Media Tracker includes a feature that allows users to hide the app icon by clicking a hide button. Once hidden, the app cannot be unhidden, providing added privacy and security.

Technologies Used:

Android SDK: Media Tracker is developed using the Android Software Development Kit for native Android application development.
Java: The app is written primarily in Java, leveraging its robust features for efficient file handling and service management.
